# BESS-Calculator

Challenge: BESS Round Trip Efficiency
& Power Loss Calculation.



 



Description:



You are tasked with creating a program that
calculates the efficiency and power loss of a BESS (Battery Energy Storage Plant).
The efficiency of a BESS Plant is determined by the ratio of energy supplied to
energy consumed. The efficiency is usually expressed as a percentage (%). Factors
that affect the efficiency of battery storage systems include losses from
batteries, power electronics, cables, transformers, and system peripherals.
Other factors such as power usage, environmental conditions, battery charge
level, and system operation mode also impact efficiency.
